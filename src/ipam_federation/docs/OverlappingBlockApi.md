# **create**
> CreateOverlappingBlockResponse create(body)

Create the overlapping block.

Use this method to create an __OverlappingBlock__ object. The __OverlappingBlock__ indicates an address range that may be managed independently by all participating IPAM services.

### Example

* Api Key Authentication (ApiKeyAuth):
```python
import os
from pprint import pprint

import ipam_federation

from bloxone_client.api_client import ApiClient
from bloxone_client.configuration import Configuration

# Defining the CSP URL is optional and defaults to "https://csp.infoblox.com"
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = Configuration(
    csp_url = os.getenv('BLOXONE_CSP_URL'),
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.

# Configure API key authorization: ApiKeyAuth
configuration.api_key = os.getenv("BLOXONE_API_KEY")

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with ApiClient(config) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = ipam_federation.OverlappingBlockApi(api_client)
    body = ipam_federation.OverlappingBlock() # OverlappingBlock | 

    try:
        # Create the overlapping block.
        api_response = api_instance.create(body)
        pprint("The response of OverlappingBlockApi->create:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        pprint("Exception when calling OverlappingBlockApi->create: %s\n" % e)

The sort direction can be specified by a suffix separated by whitespace before the tag name. The suffix 'asc' sorts the data in ascending order. The suffix 'desc' sorts the data in descending order.
